## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the Kallos software system. It outlines the objectives, features, and functionality of Kallos, along with its intended use and benefits.

### 1.2 Scope
The scope of this document encompasses the entire Kallos software system, including its core functionalities, modules, and components. It delineates the boundaries of the system and defines what is included and excluded from its scope.

### 1.3 Target Audience
The intended audience for this document includes developers, testers, project managers, and stakeholders involved in the future development and deployment of Kallos.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Overview

The system architecture of Kallos outlines the high-level structure and organization of the application. It defines how different components interact with each other to deliver the intended functionality.

### 2.2 Components

The Kallos Flask application comprises several key components that work together to provide its features and functionalities. These components include:

- **Flask Framework:** Flask serves as the foundation of the application, providing a lightweight and flexible framework for building web applications in Python.
  
- **Application Modules:** The application is organized into modules, each responsible for specific features or functionalities. These modules help maintain a clean and modular codebase.
  
- **Database Layer:** PostgreSQL is used as the database system. The database layer manages data storage and retrieval, ensuring efficient data management within the application.
  
- **Routing and Views:** Flask utilizes routing and views to map HTTPS requests to corresponding functions, allowing for the dynamic generation of web pages and responses.
  
- **Template Engine:** Flask employs a template engine, Jinja2, to generate dynamic HTML content based on data and templates, facilitating the creation of interactive web pages.
  
### 2.3 Communication Protocols

Communication protocols define how different components of the Kallos Flask application interact with each other and with external systems. Key communication protocols include:

- **HTTPS Protocol:** Secure communication between the application and clients is ensured through HTTPS protocol, providing encryption and authentication for data transfer.
  
- **RESTful API:** RESTful APIs enable communication between the Flask application and external systems or clients, allowing for the integration of third-party services or applications.
  
- **Database Communication:** The application communicates with the PostgreSQL database using database-specific protocols, SQL o, to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data.


## 3. Database Design

### 3.1 Database Schema

The database schema for the Kallos Flask application defines the structure of the database, including tables, relationships, and constraints. Below is an overview of the database schema:

- **Users Table:** Stores information about users of the application, including their unique identifier, username, email, and any other relevant user details.
  
- **Answers Table:** Contains answers submitted by users, including the answer content, the associated question or quiz, and any metadata such as timestamps or user identifiers.

### 3.2 Data Models

The data models in Kallos represent the entities and relationships within the system. Each data model corresponds to a table in the database schema and defines the structure of the data stored in that table. Here are the key data models:

- **User Model:** Represents a user of the application, including attributes such as unique user ID, username, email, and any other relevant user details.

- **Answer Model:** Represents an answer submitted by a user, including attributes such as answer content, question ID or quiz ID, and any metadata such as timestamps.

These data models are implemented using SQLAlchemy, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, which simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to work with database objects as Python objects.

## 4. Security Measures

### 4.1 Authentication

### 4.2 Authorization

### 4.3 Data Encryption

PyNaCl (Python bindings to the Networking and Cryptography library) is employed for encrypting sensitive data stored in the database. PyNaCl provides high-level cryptographic primitives for secure communication and data storage. Here's how PyNaCl is utilized for data encryption:

- **Key Generation:** Generate a secure cryptographic key using PyNaCl's `nacl.secret.SecretBox` class.

- **Encryption:** Before storing sensitive data such as user passwords or other confidential information in the database, encrypt it using PyNaCl's `nacl.secret.SecretBox.encrypt` method. This ensures that the data is securely encrypted before being stored.

- **Decryption:** When retrieving encrypted data from the database, decrypt it using PyNaCl's `nacl.secret.SecretBox.decrypt` method. Only authorized users with access to the encryption key can decrypt the data, ensuring confidentiality.
